# Scottish Haggis Data Mining Analysis

## About the Project
This project presents a comprehensive data mining analysis of Scottish haggis populations. Using a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering, classification, and regression, the study investigates morphological patterns across three species: **WildRambler**, **Macduff**, and **BogSniffler**.  

Key goals:  
- Identify morphologically distinct groups  
- Evaluate classification models for species identification  
- Explore relationships between body measurements and mass  
- Provide insights for conservation monitoring and ecological understanding  

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment
```
py -m venv .venv
```

### 2. Activate the Environment

# Windows
```
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

# macOS / Linux
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

**Replace '/path/to/requirements.txt' with your actual path**

### 4. Run the Notebook
Open `Haggis_Analysis.ipynb` (or your notebook file) in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode and run all cells sequentially.

## Notes
- All analysis is reproducible by running the notebook from top to bottom.  
- Visualizations and results rely on cleaned and preprocessed data included in the notebook.  
- Ensure Python version >=3.10 for compatibility.
