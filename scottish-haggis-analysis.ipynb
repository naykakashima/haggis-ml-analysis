    "# Final Project: Data Mining Analysis of Scottish Haggis Population\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brief Description of the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains 344 recorded sightings of the elusive Scottish haggis—a rare wildlife species recently discovered across three Scottish islands: Iona, Skye, and Shetland. Wildlife volunteers have documented three distinct species: the **Wild Rambler**, the **Macduff**, and the **Bog Sniffler**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each observation includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Morphological measurements**: nose length (mm), eye size (mm), tail length (mm), and body mass (g)\n",
    "- **Demographic data**: sex of the specimen\n",
    "- **Temporal and geographical context**: island location and year of sighting (2023–2025)\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset represents a unique opportunity to understand the physical characteristics and distributions of these newly monitored species across different island ecosystems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brief Description of the Task\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the **data mining lifecycle** by applying multiple machine learning techniques to this single dataset. Rather than simply running algorithms, the focus is on building a coherent analytical narrative—from initial data exploration through to predictive modeling—while making informed decisions at each stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Questions This Analysis Will Address:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- What patterns emerge from the physical measurements of different haggis species?\n",
    "- Can we identify natural groupings within the population using unsupervised learning?\n",
    "- How accurately can we predict species classification based on physical traits?\n",
    "- What relationships exist between specific features (e.g., body mass and morphological traits)?\n",
    "\n",
    "This investigation aims to extract meaningful biological insights while demonstrating proper application of data mining methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Techniques Will Be Applied\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis employs a progressive approach, moving from exploratory understanding to supervised prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Stage 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**\n",

    "- Optimal k selection using Elbow Method and Silhouette Score\n",
    "- Cluster characterization and interpretation\n",
    "- *Optional*: Comparison with density-based clustering (DBSCAN)\n",
    "\n",

    "- Decision Tree classifier implementation\n",
    "- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification metrics\n",
    "- Feature importance analysis\n",
    "- *Optional*: Hyperparameter tuning and ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Stage 4: Comparative Classification Analysis**\n",
    "- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** implementation with optimal k determination\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression** with coefficient interpretation\n",
    "- Performance comparison across all three classification methods\n",
    "- Analysis of which algorithm performs best for this dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Stage 5: Supervised Learning - Regression**\n",
    "- **Linear Regression** to model relationships between continuous features\n",
    "- Model evaluation using R², MAE, and RMSE\n",
    "- Interpretation of regression coefficients and model fit\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brief Outline of the Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis follows a structured, end-to-end data mining pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Data Preparation & Understanding**\n",
    "- Load the haggis dataset and perform initial inspection\n",
    "- Assess data quality (missing values, outliers, data types)\n",
    "- Create comprehensive visualizations to understand feature distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Data Cleaning & Transformation**\n",
    "- Handle missing values with justified approaches\n",
    "- Encode categorical variables (species, island, sex)\n",
    "- Scale numerical features where appropriate for specific algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Unsupervised Exploration**\n",
    "- Apply K-Means to identify natural clusters\n",
    "- Validate clustering quality and interpret biological meaning\n",
    "- Explore whether clusters align with known species boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Supervised Classification**\n",
    "- Split data into training and testing sets\n",
    "- Build Decision Tree, KNN, and Logistic Regression models\n",
    "- Compare performance and identify the most suitable classifier\n",
    "- Extract insights from feature importances and coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Regression Analysis**\n",
    "- Select appropriate continuous features for regression modeling\n",
    "- Build and evaluate linear regression model\n",
    "- Interpret relationships between physical characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Synthesis & Conclusions**\n",
    "- Integrate findings across all analytical stages\n",
    "- Discuss biological implications of discovered patterns\n",
    "- Identify limitations and potential future work\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, each decision—from choosing a value for k to selecting features for regression—will be **explicitly justified** with reference to the data, statistical principles, or domain context. The goal is not just to apply algorithms, but to tell a coherent story about what the data reveals about Scottish haggis populations."
